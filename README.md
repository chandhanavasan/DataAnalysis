# Data Analysis
To enrich my data analysis skills with the latest technologies, I dug more into Python and Databases for Data Science by doing projects using Jupyter Notebooks and building dashboards. Here are some projects:

## Analyzing the impact of GDP with the unemployment rate
Analyzing US economic data using GDP and unemployment data and measuring the impact of GDP with the unemployment rate by building the dashboard.

#### What did I learn?
- How we can convert CSV files into Dataframe.
- How we can operate on Dataframe using Pandas
- How to use Jupyter Notebook
- How to build a dashboard using Bokeh
- How to correlate and analyze two sets (GDP and unemployment)

**Skills:** Python programming, Dataframe

**Technologies:** Pandas, Bokeh, Jupyter Notebook

## Analyzing the correlation of socioeconomic indicators, public schools and crime rate
Analyzing the correlation of socioeconomic indicators, public schools, and crime data of Chicago. For instance, Income per capita would be less in the areas where there is an increased crime rate and it also impacts the rating of the schools.

#### What did I learn?
- How to connect to Database using Ipython-sql from python to SQL
- How to create tables in IBM DB2
- How to use SQL joins, filters, group by, order by, sub queries and so on
- How to analyze data using SQL

**Skills:** Python Programming, RDBMS, SQL
